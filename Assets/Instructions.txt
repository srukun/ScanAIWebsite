FONTS

	The website uses Gabarito as the font. Download the Regular 400 style here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gabarito


IMAGES/ASSETS

	I upscaled all of the necessary assets and made them available as their own file. Quality should not be an issue - just make sure that
	everything is its correct size.

	I would really like it if you could try to make the website look as close to the prototype image as possible. This means matching the
	font size exactly, lining up images/banners exactly, etc.
		I included the prototype image in this folder


Please let me know if the purpose of any of the images are unclear.

Note: The prototype I sent you through discord is a bit more finalized than the prototype I am including in this folder. That is because there
are a few things George and Davis need to tell me before I can complete the UI.

I will also spend some time making the UI for the Research, FAQ, Our Team, and Contact Us Sections. I will send a similar folder when I get those done.
